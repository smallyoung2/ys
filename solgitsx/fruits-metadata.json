2020.05.18.0\n\n### Content\n\nThe following fruits, vegetables and nuts and are included: \nApples (different varieties: Crimson Snow, Golden, Golden-Red, Granny Smith, Pink Lady, Red, Red

object per image).\n\nThe number of classes: 131 (fruits and vegetables).\n\nImage size: 100x100 pixels.\n\nFilename format: image_index_100.jpg (e.g. 32_100.jpg) or r_image_index_100.jpg (e.g. r_32_100.jpg) or r2_image_index_100.jpg or r3_image_index_100.jpg. \u0022r\u0022 stands for rotated fruit. \u0022r2\u0022 means that the fruit was rotated around the 3rd axis. \u0022100\u0022 comes from image size (100x100 pixels).\n\n**WARNING**\n\nThere is a new -major version- of the dataset under release. A test archive (named fruits-360-original-size.zip) was already loaded to Kaggle. The new version contains images at their original (captured) size.\nThe name of the image files in the new version does not contain the \u0022\\_100\u0022 suffix anymore. This will help you to make distinction between this version and the old 100x100 version.\nSo, if you use the 100x100 version, please make sure that the file names have the \u0022_100\u0022 suffix. All others MUST be ignored.\n\n**END OF WARNING**\n\nDifferent varieties of the same fruit (apple for instance) are stored as belonging to different classes.\n\n### How fruits were filmed\n\nFruits and vegetables were planted in the shaft of a low-speed motor (3 rpm) and a short movie of 20 seconds was recorded. \n\nA Logitech C920 camera was used for filming the fruits. This is one of the best webcams available.\n\nBehind the fruits, we placed a white sheet of paper as a background. \n\nHere is a movie showing how the fruits and vegetables are filmed: https://youtu.be/_HFKJ144JuU\n\n### How fruits were extracted from background \n\nHowever, due to the variations in the lighting conditions, the background was not uniform and we wrote a dedicated algorithm that extracts the fruit from the background. This algorithm is of flood fill type:  we start from each edge of the image and we mark all pixels there, then we mark all pixels found in the neighborhood of the already marked pixels for which the distance between colors is less than a prescribed value. We repeat the previous step until no more pixels can be marked.\n\nAll marked pixels are considered as being background (which is then filled with white) and the rest of the pixels are considered as belonging to the object.\n\nThe maximum value for the distance between 2 neighbor pixels is a parameter of the algorithm and is set (by trial and error) for each movie.\n\nPictures from the test-multiple_fruits folder were taken with a Nexus 5X phone.\n\n### How to cite\n\n[Mihai Oltean](https://mihaioltean.github.io), Fruits-360 dataset, 2017-\n\n### Alternate download\n\nThis dataset is also available for download from GitHub: [https://github.com/fruits-360](https://github.com/fruits-360)\n\n### History ###\n\nFruits were filmed at the dates given below (YYYY.MM.DD):\n\n2017.02.25 - Apple (golden).\n\n2017.02.28 - Apple (red-yellow, red, golden2), Kiwi, Pear, Grapefruit, Lemon, Orange, Strawberry, Banana.\n\n2017.03.05 - Apple (golden3, Braeburn, Granny Smith, red2).\n\n2017.03.07 - Apple (red3).\n\n2017.05.10 - Plum, Peach, Peach flat, Apricot, Nectarine, Pomegranate.\n\n2017.05.27 - Avocado, Papaya, Grape, Cherrie.\n\n2017.12.25 - Carambula, Cactus fruit, Granadilla, Kaki, Kumsquats, Passion fruit, Avocado ripe, Quince.\n\n2017.12.28 - Clementine, Cocos, Mango, Lime, Lychee.\n\n2017.12.31 - Apple Red Delicious, Pear Monster, Grape White.\n\n2018.01.14 - Ananas, Grapefruit Pink, Mandarine, Pineapple, Tangelo.\n\n2018.01.19 - Huckleberry, Raspberry.\n\n2018.01.26 - Dates, Maracuja, Plum 2, Salak, Tamarillo.\n\n2018.02.05 - Guava, Grape White 2, Lemon Meyer\n\n2018.02.07 - Banana Red, Pepino, Pitahaya Red.\n\n2018.02.08 - Pear Abate, Pear Williams.\n\n2018.05.22 - Lemon rotated, Pomegranate rotated.\n\n2018.05.24 - Cherry Rainier, Cherry 2, Strawberry Wedge.\n\n2018.05.26 - Cantaloupe (2 varieties).\n\n2018.05.31 - Melon Piel de Sapo.\n\n2018.06.05 - Pineapple Mini, Physalis, Physalis with Husk, Rambutan.\n\n2018.06.08 - Mulberry, Redcurrant.\n\n2018.06.16 - Hazelnut, Walnut, Tomato, Cherry Red.\n\n2018.06.17 - Cherry Wax (Yellow, Red, Black).\n\n2018.08.19 - Apple Red Yellow 2, Grape Blue, Grape White 3-4, Peach 2, Plum 3, Tomato Maroon, Tomato 1-4 .\n\n2018.12.20 - Nut Pecan, Pear Kaiser, Tomato Yellow.\n\n2018.12.21 - Banana Lady Finger, Chesnut, Mangostan.\n\n2018.12.22 - Pomelo Sweetie.\n\n2019.04.21 - Apple Crimson Snow, Apple Pink Lady, Blueberry, Kohlrabi, Mango Red, Pear Red, Pepper (Red, Yellow, Green).\n\n2019.06.18 - Beetroot Red, Corn, Ginger Root, Nectarine Flat, Nut Forest, Onion Red, Onion Red Peeled, Onion White, Potato Red, Potato Red Washed, Potato Sweet, Potato White.\n\n2019.07.07 - Cauliflower, Eggplant, Pear Forelle, Pepper Orange, Tomato Heart.\n\n2019.09.22 - Corn Husk, Cucumber Ripe, Fig, Pear 2, Pear Stone, Tomato not Ripened, Watermelon.\n\n\n## License ##\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2017-2024 [Mihai Oltean](https://mihaioltean.github.io)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \u0022Software\u0022), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u0022AS IS\u0022, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
